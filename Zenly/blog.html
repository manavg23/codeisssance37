                <p>One of the most underrated Indian cuisine, Sindhi food is spectacular and needs to be spoken about more often. Alka Keswani runs a food blog since 2008 and dives deep into traditional recipes that range from basic Sindhi curry and aloo tuk to nuanced recipes like kuneh ja bhee (steamed lotus stem chaat) and awran jo murabo (gooseberry conserve), all that suit a growing adult’s meal plan. She has a special kid’s corner on her blog where this mom of one shares recipes that will win the fussiest of eaters. These feature dal sandwiches, tuk chaat, kulfi and so on. Since Sindhi food isn’t too heavy on dairy, some of these ideas fit those following a vegan diet plan too.</p>
